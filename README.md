# Virtual-Drawing-Pad

In touch enabled machines, apps developed on different platforms provide flexibility to draw anything on computer canvas (which is screen) using finger-tip. Here we are presenting a method to perform the same action by not touching the screen. The paper discusses the implementation of a virtual drawing pad using finger-tip with the help of image processing techniques, where touch enabled device is not required.
